## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction-api.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask mlflow joblib
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Send a POST request to the API with property features to receive price predictions. Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "square_footage": 2000,
        "lot_size": 5000,
        "num_bedrooms": 3,
        "num_bathrooms": 2,
        "location": "suburban"
    }'
    ```

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains essential property features such as:
- **Square Footage**: Total area of the property in square feet.
- **Lot Size**: Area of the lot on which the property is situated.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the property.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: Total number of bathrooms in the property.
- **Location-Based Features**: Includes factors like neighborhood ratings and proximity to amenities.

Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted for use with the API.
