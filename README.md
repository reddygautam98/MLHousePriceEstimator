# üè° House Price Prediction API

## üåü Introduction

In today‚Äôs real estate market, **accurate pricing predictions** are vital for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions. The **House Price Prediction API** leverages **machine learning** to estimate house prices based on critical property features, including square footage, lot size, and location-specific details.

This project employs a **Linear Regression** model, designed to analyze various property characteristics and predict the price of a home. By using this model in a **Flask web application**, we provide a **scalable**, **API-first solution** that can easily integrate with other applications, allowing for **real-time predictions**.
